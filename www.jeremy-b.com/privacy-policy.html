<li><strong>DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION</strong></li>
<li><strong>HOW TO CONTACT US</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR SITES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our websites, blogs, Discord server, online forums we operate or may at any time in the future operate, and user research we conduct as our “<strong>Websites</strong>” or “<strong>Sites</strong>”, and the products, promotions, and services we offer, for example our videos and media, as our “<strong>Services</strong>” and our “<strong>Software</strong>”. Our Sites, Services, and Software may collect information from you, including your personal information, in the manner and means described below.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our Sites, Services, and Software that link to this Privacy Policy, including our company website at https://jeremy-b.com/. If we change this Privacy Policy, your use, continued use, and access of our Websites, Services, and Software constitutes acceptance of such change.</p>
<p>BY USING ANY OF OUR SITES, SERVICES, OR SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE OUR SITES, SERVICES, OR SOFTWARE.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is defined independently by governmental entities around the world. We consider personal information to be any data that can be used to identify you such as your name, email, address, identification numbers (such as social security number, employee number, and driver’s license number), your location data, online identifiers (such as your IP addresses, geographic location data and coordinates, and log-on IDs), and any information relating to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. The personal information we collect is explained below, as well as why we collect it and what we use it for, and you have the right to request this information from us and to request that we remove it from our servers and systems.</p>
<p>If you would like us not to collect or use your personal information, or if you would like us to correct your personal information, please contact us at <u><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="60090e060f200a0512050d194d024e030f0d">[email&#160;protected]</a></u> and we will endeavor to remove or correct this information as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN ONLINE</strong></p>
<p>We recognize the importance of protecting children’s privacy online, and we are committed to complying fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States and similar statutes and laws around the world. We encourage parents and guardians to discuss with their children what information should be released on the Internet, especially personal information.</p>
<p>Although countries may apply different minimum age guidelines when determining the age at which children can access online content, our Sites, Services, and Software are not intended for children under the age of 13 or the age of majority, whichever is less. Within the United States, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Outside of the United States, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the relevant age threshold applicable to the country or jurisdiction where a user may reside. In some geographical areas, our Websites or Services may not be accessible to anyone under the age of 18, regardless of whether a parent or guardian has provided consent.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, do not submit any personal information to us. If we later learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under the age of 13, regardless of where that child resides, we will remove this information from our records as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately at <u><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="472e292128072d2235222a3e6a256924282a">[email&#160;protected]</a></u> (or contact us at the physical address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy) and we will promptly take the necessary steps to remove all such information.</p>

If for any reason you receive a direct advertisement from us and believe you did not consent to it, please contact us at <u><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="076e696168476d6275626a7e2a652964686a">[email&#160;protected]</a>,</u> and we will ensure that your name and email address is removed from any future direct ad. You may also review the section below, YOUR RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR USE AND STORAGE OF THE INFORMATION, to better understand your rights and our duties regarding direct advertising.</p>
<p><strong>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small file that may be stored on your computer or mobile device. Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer. Cookies allow us to see what you may have purchased from our Site or through our Services and Software. We may send you notifications based on information we learn from cookies, including notifications related to purchasing additional products from us, in accord with this Privacy Policy. Specifically, we may use cookies in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may use <strong><u>session cookies</u></strong> to make it easier for you to navigate our Websites and certain online Services and Software. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you disable session cookies, many of the services and products we offer will not operate correctly.</li>
<li>In some cases, we use <strong><u>persistent</u></strong> cookies to enable us to track and target our Websites visitors’ interests and to enhance their overall experience. If you check “<em>remember me on this computer</em>” when logging on our Sites, we may set a persistent cookie to store your username and password so that you do not have to enter it more than once. A persistent cookie is removed when you uncheck the checkbox.</li>
<li>We may use <strong>tracking pixels</strong> or <strong>clear GIFs</strong> to collect information about your use of our Sites, Services, and Software.</li>
<li>We may also use <strong>Analytics</strong>, <strong>Advertising</strong>, <strong>Anti-Cheat</strong>, and <strong>Anti-Fraud</strong> technologies, and<strong> Internet log files</strong> to manage traffic on our Websites and in conjunction with our Services and Software, to detect and solve technical problems, and to detect and prevent fraud. Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat, and Anti-Fraud technologies may employ cookies to provide the data these technologies require. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. You may opt out of certain types of tracking on the web, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser or via our consent tools.</li>
<li>The information collected from <strong>Google Analytics cookies</strong> is stored on Google Servers and can be accessed by us. Google may also transfer this information to third parties when required to do so by law, or when such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.</li>
<li>Additionally, our <strong>third-party business partners and affiliates</strong> may employ cookies, although we have no control over this use or practice, nor do we have access or control over these cookies. <u>This privacy policy only covers the use of cookies by us</u> and does not cover the use of cookies by our advertisers or our third-party business partners and affiliates.</li>
<li>You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Refer to your individual web browser settings if you need help in managing your cookie preferences. By limiting your cookies, your use of certain Websites and Services features may be limited or unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION AND WHY?</strong></p>
<p><strong>WE DO NOT SELL YOUR INFORMATION.</strong> Neither we nor our third-party business partners or affiliates or developers intend to sell, share, or rent information obtained from our Sites, Services, and Software, other than as discussed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>MERGER OR ACQUISITION.</strong> While Gaming Curios does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users to third parties, except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, the customer information (including your personally identifiable information) we maintain may be transferred to our successors or assigns, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.</strong> We may release information concerning your use of our Sites, Services, and Software (including, but not limited to, public postings, registration information, network records, and geographic and tracking data) when we believe in good faith that such release is appropriate; to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant, or court order); to protect against fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Sites, Services, and Software, and to protect our rights and property (including the rights and property of our third-party business partners and affiliates); to enforce any contract between you and us, including with our third-party business partners and affiliates; and if we reasonably believe that a situation involving danger of death or injury to any person requires disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH ADVERTISING PARTNERS</strong>. We may allow third-party partners to set technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your use of our Sites, Services, and Software, including your IP address, mobile identifiers, the pages you have visited, your location, browser information, the activities you engaged in on our Websites or through our Services, and when you visited. We or our advertising partners may also combine and share such information in an aggregate form. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks. Since the information is collected in aggregate, the statistics are generated anonymously. These statistics help us in connection with marketing and demographic studies as we enhance our Sites. Gaming Curios does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user’s session will be logged but the user remains anonymous to us. Gaming Curios can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy or to protect our Services, Websites or a person or entity. If you prefer that we not share your personal information with third-party advertising partners, you may contact us at <u><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="50393e363f103a3522353d297d327e333f3d">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</u></p>
<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR EMAIL PURPOSES</strong>. We may share or use third party services for email processing such as Kajabi, MailChimp or MailerLite.</p>
<p><strong>DATA RETENTION AND SECURITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>SECURITY.</strong> Gaming Curios has security measures in place to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Gaming Curios uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information such as firewalls and encryption. While “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, we work hard to ensure your secure use of our services.</p>
<p><strong>STORAGE</strong>. Your information is stored primarily in the United States. We take prudent security measures to protect you and the information we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction. These measures include encrypting your information on our servers, keeping your sensitive information on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on our site or mobile application using secure socket layer technology (SSL), periodic reviews of our data collection practices and platforms, and physical security measures that guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store your information.</p>
<p><strong>RETENTION</strong>. We will keep your information only for as long as reasonably necessary, including while your account is active and for so long as it may be required to fulfill our legal obligations. If you would like us to delete your account or request that we no longer use your information, please contact us at <u><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="375e595158775d5245525a4e1a551954585a">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</u></p>

<p><strong>DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>RESOLVING DISPUTES. </strong>You agree that in the event of a dispute between you and Gaming Curios or Gaming Curios’ affiliates, third-party developers, or partners, you will make a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least sixty (60) days before initiating arbitration (as provided below). This informal, good faith negotiation will commence upon receipt of written notice from you, provided also that your notice includes your full name and address (as the complaining party); the nature and basis of your claim or dispute sufficiently detailed; and the specific relief you seek.</p>
<p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION. </strong>In the event our good faith dispute negotiations fail after the expiration of the 60-day period, as provided in the prior paragraph, you agree that any disputes or claims that you may have against us or our affiliates, third-party developers, or partners will be (except as stated below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Specifically, we each agree that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Product shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
<p>The above arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">http://www.jamsadr.com</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, but will not incorporate the JAMS Class Action Procedures, and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees.</p>
<p>Further, you understand and agree that regardless of the country or state in which you live, arbitration will take place in Travis County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Travis County, Texas, to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC ACCESS TO ARBITRATION RECORDS.</strong> After the conclusion of arbitration, the parties shall make all arbitration documents available to third parties upon written request unless the parties agree in writing to limit disclosure or disclosure is otherwise limited by law, order, motion, or privilege. Before disclosing any document, the parties shall redact all personal information and personal identifiers including, but not limited to, any person’s social security number, driver license number, address, telephone number, and financial account number</p>
<p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> We each further agree that any arbitration related to this Agreement will be conducted in our individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and we each expressly waive our right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. This means you can only bring a claim against Gaming Curios or Gaming Curios’ affiliates, representatives, employees, and directors in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTION</strong>. Notwithstanding our mutual decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Product under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES</strong>. Gaming Curios agrees to provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>
<p><strong>JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW. </strong>In connection with any dispute between us, whether in arbitration or otherwise shall be interpreted and bound by the State of Texas, United States of America, and United States federal law. We each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal courts in Travis County, Texas to resolve any claims that are subject to exceptions to the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>SEVERABILITY AND INTEGRATION. </strong>This Agreement and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on this Website constitute the entire agreement between you and Gaming Curios and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION. </strong>We reserve the right to terminate your use of our Websites, Services, or Software if you violate these this Agreement, our Community Guidelines, our Privacy Policy, or any of our End User License Agreements (EULAs), or any rule or guideline posted on this Website, in our Services or Software, or in our content, or for any other reason in our sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>ALLEGED VIOLATIONS. </strong>To ensure that Gaming Curios provides a high-quality experience for you and other users of our Websites, Services, Software, and content, you agree that Gaming Curios and its affiliates, third-party developers and partners may access your account and records on a case-by-case basis to investigate complaints or allegations of abuse, infringement of third-party rights, or other unauthorized uses of this Website and Services. Gaming Curios does not intend to disclose the existence or occurrence of such an investigation unless required by law, but we reserve the right to terminate your account or your access to this Website and Services immediately, with or without notice to you, and without liability to you, if we believe that you have violated this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or our other published policies regarding your use and access of our Websites, Services, Software, and content, or that you have furnished us with false or misleading information or have otherwise interfered with use of our Websites and/or our Services or Software.</p>
