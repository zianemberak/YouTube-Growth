<ol start="16">
<li><strong> Indemnification. </strong>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our third-party developers and partners, including their respective employees, contractors, officers, directors, and agents from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees, that arise from your use or misuse our Websites and Services. We and our affiliates, third-party developers, and partners reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</li>
<li><strong> Resolving Disputes. </strong>You agree that in the event of a dispute between you and Gaming Curios or our affiliates, third-party developers, or partners, you will make a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least sixty (60) days before initiating arbitration (as provided below). This informal, good faith negotiation will commence upon receipt of written notice from you, provided also that your notice includes your full name and address (as the complaining party); the nature and basis of your claim or dispute sufficiently detailed; and the specific relief you seek.</li>
<li><strong> Binding Arbitration. </strong>In the event our good faith dispute negotiations fail at the expiration of the 30-day period, as provided I the prior paragraph, you agree that any disputes or claims that you may have against us or our affiliates, third-party developers, or partners will be (except as stated below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Specifically, we each agree that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Product shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">http://www.jamsadr.com</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, but will not incorporate the JAMS Class Action Procedures, and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees.</p>
<p>Further, you understand and agree that regardless of the country or state in which you live, arbitration will take place in Travis County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Travis County, Texas, to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong> Class Action Waiver.</strong> We each further agree that any arbitration or other cause of action related to this Agreement will be conducted in our individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and we each expressly waive our right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. This means you can only bring a claim against Gaming Curios or Gaming Curios’ affiliates, representatives, employees, and directors in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
<li><strong> Exception TO BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>. Notwithstanding our mutual decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Product under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</li>
<li><strong> CHANGES TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT</strong>. Gaming Curios agrees to provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</li>
<li><strong> JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW. </strong>In connection with any dispute between us, whether in arbitration or otherwise shall be interpreted and bound by the laws of the state of Texas and United States federal law. We each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal courts in Travis County, Texas to resolve any claims that are subject to exceptions to the arbitration agreement.</li>
<li><strong> Severability and Integration. </strong>This Agreement and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on our Websites constitute the entire agreement between you and Gaming Curios and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li><strong> Termination. </strong>We reserve the right to terminate your use of our Websites and Services if you violate these this Agreement, our Community Guidelines, our Privacy Policy, or any of our End User License Agreements (EULAs), or any rule or guideline posted on our Websites, related to our Services, or in our Content, or for any other reason in our sole discretion.</li>
<li><strong> Investigating Alleged Violations. </strong>To ensure that Gaming Curios provides a high-quality experience for you and other users of our Websites or Services, and content, you agree that Gaming Curios and its affiliates, third-party developers and partners may access your account and records on a case-by-case basis to investigate complaints or allegations of abuse, infringement of third-party rights, or other unauthorized uses of our Websites and Services. Gaming Curios does not intend to disclose the existence or occurrence of such an investigation unless required by law, but we reserve the right to terminate your account or your access to our Websites and Services immediately, with or without notice to you, and without liability to you, if we believe that you have violated this Agreement, our Community Guidelines, or our Privacy Policy, or have furnished us with false or misleading information, or have otherwise interfered with use of our Websites and Services.</li>
<li><strong> Claims of Copyright Infringement. </strong>Gaming Curios respects the intellectual property rights of others and complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”), which provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Any user who is found to have infringed the rights of Gaming Curios, its affiliates, third-party developers, partners, or any third-party, or otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or regulations is subject to immediate suspension and/or termination.</li>
